 # 👋 Hey, I'm [Yash]  
HereWeGoAgain
I’m a curious mind who loves turning ideas into reality through code.  
💻 Coding started as a hobby — now it’s the language I think in.  

When I’m not solving bugs or building something new, you’ll probably find me:  
🎸 Playing guitar (self-taught ),  
🧩 Speed-solving cubes (National Gold & Bronze, State Gold ,District Champion),  
✏️ Sketching whatever inspires me.  

### 💡 What I love
- Writing clean, creative code  
- Exploring web technologies (C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,)  
- Learning something new every single day  

### 🌱 Currently
- Experimenting with front-end projects  
- Leveling up my problem-solving and logic-building skills  

> “Code, create, repeat — that’s how I grow.”
